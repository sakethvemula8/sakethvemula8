  <h1>DevOps Deployment Analysis on Azure and AWS</h1>
  <p class="overview">
    This project explores how DevOps deployments perform across AWS and Azure, and how data can help uncover ways to make them faster and more efficient. 
    As a data analyst, I focused on identifying patterns, building predictive models, and translating technical results into insights that DevOps and cloud 
    teams could actually use.

  <h2>What Problem Are We Solving?</h2>
  <p>
    As cloud adoption accelerates, organizations are investing heavily in DevOps practices to enable continuous delivery and scale operations. However, even
    with modern CI/CD pipelines, businesses often face: <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Long and unpredictable deployment times <br> 
      ‚Ä¢ Excessive resource consumption, inflating cloud costs <br> 
      ‚Ä¢ Inconsistent performance across cloud providers <br> 
  </p>

  <h2>üîç Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Insurance charges were highly skewed ‚Äî applied log transformation to normalize.</li>
    <li><strong>Top predictors:</strong> age, BMI, and smoking status.</li>
    <li>Gender and region showed minimal predictive power.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üß† Analytical Approach</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Performed EDA with histograms, boxplots, and a correlation heatmap.</li>
    <li>Created new feature <code>log_charges</code> to stabilize variance.</li>
    <li>Built a linear regression model and evaluated performance with R¬≤ and MSE.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚úÖ Solution & Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Enabled fairer and more data-driven insurance pricing by predicting costs based on key health and demographic variables. Supports strategic underwriting and pricing.
  </p>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies</h2>
  <p>Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>
