  <h1>DevOps Deployment Analysis: Azure/AWS</h1>
  <p class="overview">
    This project explores how DevOps deployments perform across AWS and Azure, and how data can help uncover ways to make them faster and more efficient. 
    As a data analyst, I focused on identifying patterns, building predictive models, and translating technical results into insights that DevOps and cloud 
    teams could actually use.

<h3>üß© What Problem Are We Solving?</h3>
  <p>As cloud adoption accelerates, organizations are investing heavily in DevOps practices to enable continuous delivery and scale operations. 
    However, even with modern CI/CD pipelines, businesses often face:
  <ul>
    <li>Long and unpredictable deployment times</li>
    <li>Excessive resource consumption, inflating cloud costs</li>
    <li>Inconsistent performance across cloud providers</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>The central question:</strong><br>
  How can we optimize DevOps efficiency and reliability across different cloud platforms like AWS and Azure?</p>
    <br> <br>

  <h3>The Solution: A Data-Driven Efficiency Analysis</h3>
  <p>To solve this, I analyzed <strong>50,000+ deployment records</strong> across AWS and Azure using Python-based data 
    science workflows. The goal was to identify performance bottlenecks, uncover hidden patterns, and recommend optimization strategies.</p>

  <p><strong>Key steps included:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify patterns in deployment time, resource usage, scalability, and reliability.</li>
    <li>Correlation Analysis to quantify relationships between KPIs (e.g., time vs. resource usage).</li>
    <li>Regression Models to predict deployment durations using cloud-specific features.</li>
    <li>Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical) to group similar deployment scenarios for targeted improvements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>I Answered The Below Business Questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which platform is more scalable or reliable for large-scale deployments?</strong><br>
    <em>AWS had higher scalability scores, while Azure performed better on reliability metrics.</em></li>

    <li><strong>What‚Äôs the relationship between deployment time and resource usage?</strong><br>
    <em>A 0.99 correlation suggests faster deployments = lower cloud costs.</em></li>

    <li><strong>Can we predict inefficient deployments before they happen?</strong><br>
    <em>Yes ‚Äî using gradient boosting and random forest models, we achieved strong predictive performance.</em></li>

    <li><strong>Which types of deployments need attention?</strong><br>
    <em>Cluster analysis revealed that ~30% of deployments consistently exceeded 80 hours, mostly on Azure with high memory usage.</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools & Skills Demonstrated</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cloud Platforms:</strong> AWS, Azure</li>
    <li><strong>Languages/Libraries:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn</li>
    <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Regression modeling, Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), Correlation analysis, Data storytelling</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>What‚Äôs Next?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding real-time monitoring data for live feedback loops</li>
    <li>Exploring neural networks for deeper performance prediction</li>
    <li>Integrating deployment metadata from CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>This capstone was not just an academic challenge but a practical deep-dive into how data can drive DevOps transformation. By combining ML models with cloud performance metrics, I was able to uncover insights that DevOps and cloud teams can act on.</p>
