  <h1>DevOps Deployment Analysis on Azure/AWS</h1>
  <p class="overview">
    This project explores how DevOps deployments perform across AWS and Azure, and how data can help uncover ways to make them faster and more efficient. 
    As a data analyst, I focused on identifying patterns, building predictive models, and translating technical results into insights that DevOps and cloud 
    teams could actually use.
  </p>

  <h2>What Problem Are We Solving?</h2>
  <p>
    As cloud adoption accelerates, organizations are investing heavily in DevOps practices to enable continuous delivery and scale operations. However, even
    with modern CI/CD pipelines, businesses often face: 
    <ul>
      <li>Long and unpredictable deployment times.</li> 
      <li>Excessive resource consumption, inflating cloud costs.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent performance across cloud providers.</li> 
    </ul>
    The central question: <br>
    <strong>How can we optimize DevOps efficiency and reliability across different cloud platforms like AWS and Azure?</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>The Solution: A Data-Driven Efficiency Analysis</h2>
    <p>To solve this, I analyzed 50,000+ deployment records across AWS and Azure using Python-based data science workflows. The goal
      was to identify performance bottlenecks, uncover hidden patterns, and recommend optimization strategies. <br>
      Key steps included:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)</strong> to identify patterns in deployment time, resource usage, scalability, and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong> to quantify relationships between KPIs (e.g., time vs. resource usage).</li>
        <li><strong>Regression Models</strong> to predict deployment durations using cloud-specific features.</li>
        <li><strong>Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical)</strong> to group similar deployment scenarios for targeted improvements.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h2>Business Questions Answered:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Which platform is more scalable or reliable for large-scale deployments?</strong></li> <br>
                <p><i></i>Found that AWS had higher scalability scores, while Azure performed better on reliability metrics.</i></p>
    <li><strong>What‚Äôs the relationship between deployment time and resource usage?</li> <br>
                <p><i></i>A 0.99 correlation suggests faster deployments = lower cloud costs.</i></p>
    <li>Built a linear regression model and evaluated performance with R¬≤ and MSE.</li>
  </ul>
