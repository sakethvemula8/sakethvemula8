  <h1>DevOps Deployment Analysis: Azure/AWS</h1>
  <p class="overview">
    This project explores how DevOps deployments perform across AWS and Azure, and how data can help uncover ways to make them faster and more efficient. 
    As a data analyst, I focused on identifying patterns, building predictive models, and translating technical results into insights that DevOps and cloud 
    teams could actually use.
  </p>

<h2>The Business Problem</h2>
  <p>In today’s cloud-driven DevOps world, organizations rely on continuous delivery pipelines to ship code quickly and reliably. But even with automation, many teams face a familiar set of challenges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Long and unpredictable deployment times</li>
    <li>Excessive resource usage that inflates cloud costs</li>
    <li>Inconsistent performance between platforms like AWS and Azure</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This project set out to answer a critical question:<br>
  <strong>How can organizations quantify and optimize their cloud-based DevOps deployments to achieve faster, more cost-effective, and reliable delivery?</strong></p>

  <h2>Who Is This For?</h2>
  <p>This work directly benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>DevOps engineers and Cloud architects optimizing CI/CD pipelines</li>
    <li>IT managers and FinOps teams seeking cost-efficient operations</li>
    <li>Organizations deploying applications on multi-cloud environments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By delivering concrete, data-backed insights into where and why deployments slow down or become costly, this study helps teams make informed decisions about infrastructure and tooling.</p>
  <h2>The Approach & Tools</h2>
  <p>Using a Kaggle dataset of 50,000 deployment records, I applied a structured, data science-driven process:</p>

  <h3>1. Preprocessing & EDA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cleaned and validated numerical data (no missing values or categorical variables)</li>
    <li>Explored patterns in deployment time, resource usage, and platform metrics like AWS Scalability and Azure Reliability</li>
    <li>Found that most deployments took 20–80 hours and used similar ranges of cloud resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Correlation Analysis</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Uncovered a 0.99 correlation between deployment time and resource usage — meaning time is a direct cost driver</li>
    <li>Noted strong positive correlations between DevOps Efficiency Score and AWS Scalability (0.72), Azure Reliability (0.71)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Regression Modeling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression (baseline, weak R²)</li>
    <li>Decision Tree (overfit)</li>
    <li>Random Forest (improved stability)</li>
    <li>Gradient Boosting (best performance but still low R²)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Even advanced models struggled to predict time accurately — pointing to missing contextual features like team expertise or toolchain complexity.</em></p>

  <h3>4. Clustering Analysis</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>K-Means (4 clusters): Identified patterns such as high efficiency + low usage and low efficiency + high cost</li>
    <li>Hierarchical Clustering validated K-Means structure</li>
    <li>DBSCAN didn’t perform well due to uniform density in the data</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Clustering gave far clearer insights than regression. It helped segment deployments into actionable groups for optimization.</em></p>

  <h2>What Business Questions Did This Project Answer?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Can we identify which deployments are inefficient?</strong><br>→ Yes. Clustering revealed ~30% of deployments with long durations and high resource drain.</li>
    <li><strong>What drives deployment inefficiency?</strong><br>→ High correlation between time and cost; unoptimized pipelines are expensive pipelines.</li>
    <li><strong>Is one platform better than the other?</strong><br>→ AWS showed better scalability; Azure scored higher on reliability. Each has distinct strengths.</li>
    <li><strong>Can we predict deployment time?</strong><br>→ To some extent, but real-world deployments likely require additional qualitative inputs for stronger prediction accuracy.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Languages: Python</li>
    <li>Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn</li>
    <li>ML Techniques: Regression, Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)</li>
    <li>Data Source: Kaggle (50K deployment records)</li>
    <li>Metrics Analyzed: Deployment Time, Resource Usage, Efficiency, AWS Scalability, Azure Reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Time = money in cloud deployments. Reducing hours saves resources.</li>
    <li>Platform matters. Teams should choose based on whether they prioritize scalability (AWS) or reliability (Azure).</li>
    <li>Clustering is powerful. It offers a way to segment, diagnose, and optimize deployments beyond basic dashboards.</li>
    <li>Regression has limits without qualitative context — highlighting a potential area for future mixed-method analysis.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Incorporate real-time monitoring logs to track live deployment metrics</li>
    <li>Include cost metadata from AWS CloudWatch or Azure Monitor for true FinOps analysis</li>
    <li>Try neural networks or LSTM models to model complex temporal patterns</li>
    <li>Expand to multi-cloud pipelines, comparing hybrid setups and cross-provider deployments</li>
  </ul>
