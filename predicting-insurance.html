  <h2>Predicting Insurance Costs with Linear Regression</h2>
  <p><strong>Business Problem:</strong> Health insurance providers need accurate cost predictions to set fair premiums. With rising healthcare costs, poor estimations can lead to financial losses or unfair pricing for customers.</p>

  <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Insurance charges were highly skewed — <em>log transformation</em> was applied for normalization.</li>
    <li><strong>Top predictors:</strong> age, BMI, and smoking status (especially smokers with higher costs).</li>
    <li>Minimal impact from gender or region.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Analytical Approach:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Performed EDA with visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.</li>
    <li>Selected key features and built a linear regression model on log-transformed charges.</li>
    <li>Evaluated using R² and MSE to check accuracy and variance explanation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Solution & Impact:</strong> Developed a predictive model that helps insurance firms price policies based on customer characteristics like age, BMI, and smoking status. This leads to smarter risk assessment and premium setting.</p>

  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn</p>
