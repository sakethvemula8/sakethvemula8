<h2>Why Only SQL</h2>
  <p>In a world of Pandas, Power BI, and Tableau, it’s easy to forget that SQL alone is incredibly powerful. 
    When you're working, people often say they work with SQL, but what does that mean? Is SQL alone enough to do basically everything an Analyst needs?</p>
    <p><bold>Can I extract all the insights I need from a database using just SQL?</bold></p>
    <p>Spoiler: You can.</p>
    
  <h2>Create the Right Schema for Analysis</h2>
  <p> Start with a clean, normalized schema.</p>
  <p><code>CREATE TABLE books (
    isbn VARCHAR(17) PRIMARY KEY,
    book_title VARCHAR(65),
    category VARCHAR(20),
    rental_price FLOAT,
    status VARCHAR(10),
    author VARCHAR(50),
    publisher VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE issued_status (
    issued_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    issued_member_id VARCHAR(20),  
    issued_book_name VARCHAR(80),
    issued_date DATE,
    issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(75), 
    issued_emp_id VARCHAR(20)
);
  </code></p>
  <p>This structure helps us link books to who issued them, when, and how often.</p>
    
  
    <h2>Analyze Which Books Are Issued the Most</h2>
  <p>To understand demand patterns:</p>
  <p><code>SELECT 
    b.book_title,
    COUNT(i.issued_id) AS total_issues
FROM books b
JOIN issued_status i ON b.isbn = i.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY b.book_title
ORDER BY total_issues DESC
LIMIT 10;
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Shows top 10 most borrowed books.</p>

    <h2>Find Total Rental Revenue by Book Category</h2>
  <p>Estimate potential revenue from each genre:</p>
  <p><code>SELECT 
    b.category,
    COUNT(i.issued_id) AS times_issued,
    SUM(b.rental_price) AS estimated_revenue
FROM books b
JOIN issued_status i ON b.isbn = i.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY b.category
ORDER BY estimated_revenue DESC;
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Tells you which genres are profitable.</p>

    <h2>Find Members With High Activity</h2>
  <p>Who are your most active library users?</p>
  <p><code>
    SELECT 
    issued_member_id,
    COUNT(*) AS books_issued
FROM issued_status
GROUP BY issued_member_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Target these members for loyalty programs or premium memberships.</p>

    <h2>Track Recent User Growth</h2>
  <p>Want to know if your library is growing?</p>
  <p><code>
    SELECT *
FROM members
WHERE reg_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '180 days';
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Track user acquisition over time.</p>

    <h2>Detect Books Not Returned Yet</h2>
  <p>Identify overdue or missing returns:</p>
  <p><code>
    SELECT i.issued_id, i.issued_book_name, i.issued_member_id
FROM issued_status i
LEFT JOIN return_status r ON i.issued_id = r.issued_id
WHERE r.return_id IS NULL;
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Operational alert, follow up on these books.</p>

    <h2>Detect Books Not Returned Yet</h2>
  <p>Identify overdue or missing returns:</p>
  <p><code>
    SELECT i.issued_id, i.issued_book_name, i.issued_member_id
FROM issued_status i
LEFT JOIN return_status r ON i.issued_id = r.issued_id
WHERE r.return_id IS NULL;
  </code></p>
  <p>Insight: Operational alert, follow up on these books.</p>

    <h2>Detect Books Not Returned Yet</h2>
  <p>Identify overdue or missing returns:</p>
  <p><code>
    CREATE TABLE book_issued_cnt AS
SELECT b.isbn, b.book_title, COUNT(i.issued_id) AS issue_count
FROM books b
JOIN issued_status i ON b.isbn = i.issued_book_isbn
GROUP BY b.isbn, b.book_title;
  </code></p>
  <p>Now you have a ready-to-use table for dashboards or BI tools.</p>
    
  <h2>Finally,</h2>
    <p>SQL is more than just a database language, it's a full-fledged analysis tool.</p>
    <p>No spreadsheets <br>
       No Python <br>
      No BI tool </p>
    <p>Just raw SQL power.</p>
