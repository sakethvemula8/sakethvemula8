  <h1>Snowflake Analytics</h1>
  <h2>Scalable Order & Shipping Insights with Snowpark Pandas</h2>
  <p class="overview">
    Avalanche is a fast-growing winter sports gear company, known for delivering everything from snowboards to ski goggles. 
    But with growth came new headaches. As customer demand surged, so did delivery delays, order fulfillment hiccups, and unreliable 
    shipping partners. The team needed more than guesswork—they needed clear, data-backed answers. To tackle the problem, I built a 
    scalable analytics pipeline powered by Snowflake’s Snowpark and the Pandas API via Modin, all within a Python environment. 
    This setup helped Avalanche dig deep into their shipping and order data without sacrificing performance or flexibility. 
    The outcome? Smarter decisions, faster deliveries, and happier customers.
  </p>

<h2>Business Problem</h2>
  <p>As Avalanche scaled, so did their logistical complexity. Orders were being delayed, some shipping partners were 
    underperforming, and customer complaints were on the rise. The company wanted to understand:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which regions are experiencing chronic shipping delays?</li>
    <li>Which shipping providers deliver fastest and most reliably?</li>
    <li>How does delivery time vary by product type and order size?</li>
    <li>Are there seasonal patterns in delays or high-performing zones?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>They needed answers at scale, and they needed them fast.<br>

  <h2>The Snowflake + Snowpark Advantage</h2>
  <p>Traditional pandas pipelines struggle with scale. That’s why this project leverages Snowpark for Python with Modin, 
    offering the ability to write familiar pandas-style code while executing it in a distributed, cloud-native environment directly on Snowflake. Here's how it works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The project initiates a <code>Snowpark</code> session within a Jupyter notebook.</li>
    <li>All transformation logic, from filtering to group-bys, is done via Snowflake’s compute engine behind the scenes.</li>
    <li>The use of query tagging ensures traceability and observability during production.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This hybrid architecture provides the best of both worlds—developer ergonomics and enterprise-grade scalability.</p>
 
  <h2>Data Pipeline Overview</h2>
  <p>After ingesting order and shipping data from Avalanche’s cloud warehouse, the pipeline:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Cleans and preprocesses the data using Snowpark's DataFrame API and pandas-on-Snowflake.</li>
    <li>Calculates key metrics such as: Average delivery time by region and shipping partner, On-time delivery rate across months, 
      Delayed shipments breakdown by product category.</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Tools & Techniques</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Snowflake: Scalable data warehouse</li>
    <li>Snowpark: Python API for in-database compute</li>
    <li>Modin: Distributed pandas for performance</li>
    <li>Seaborn: Data visualization</li>
    <li>Jupyter: Interactive development & storytelling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <p>This project is a real-world demonstration of how modern analytics stacks can empower operations teams. 
    By combining Snowflake’s scalability with the expressive flexibility of pandas, the Avalanche team is now equipped to 
    make data-driven logistical decisions—ensuring faster shipping, optimized vendor contracts, and happier customers.
Whether you're a data professional or a business leader, this pipeline shows how cloud-native data science can transform operational efficiency at scale.</p>
